Hi, I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), advised by Professor [Mark D. Smucker](https://uwaterloo.ca/management-science-engineering/profile/msmucker), and a member of the [Data Systems Group](https://uwaterloo.ca/data-systems-group/).

I design and evaluate retrievalâ€‘augmented generation (RAG) systems and LLMs from the user's perspective, building datasets, metrics, and experiments that reflect real human alignment and utility.
I lead the organization of the [TREC 2024 Lateral Reading Track](https://trec-lateral-reading.github.io/) and the [TREC 2025 DRAGUN Track](https://trec-dragun.github.io/).
My work also benefits from close collaborations with Professor [Charles L. A. Clarke](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~claclark/) and Professor [Robin Cohen](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rcohen/), whose expertise helps inform and enhance my independent research.

Previously, I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) and my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/).
