Hi, I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), advised by Professor [Mark D. Smucker](https://uwaterloo.ca/management-science-engineering/profile/msmucker), and a member of the [Data Systems Group](https://uwaterloo.ca/data-systems-group/).

My current research focuses on Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, and Artificial Intelligence, with an aim of helping Internet users evaluate the trustworthiness of online information more effectively and efficiently.
My work also benefits from close collaborations with Professor [Charles L. A. Clarke](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~claclark/) and Professor [Robin Cohen](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rcohen/), whose expertise helps inform and enhance my independent research.

Previously, I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) and my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/).
